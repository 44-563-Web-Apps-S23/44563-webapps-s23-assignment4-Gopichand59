            <h2>A DOLLAR by DAVID PINSKI</h2>
            <p>
                VILLAIN. [_Exhausted._] Who will lend me a hand to wipe off my
perspiration? It has a nasty way of streaming into my mouth.
            </p>
            <p>
                [_He drops his arms, the bundles fall down. He then sinks down onto
                one of them and wipes off the perspiration, moving his hand wearily
                over his face. The_ TRAGEDIAN _and the_ "OLD MAN" _approach the
                post and read the signs_.
            </p>
            <p>
                TRAGEDIAN. [_In a deep, dramatic voice._] It's hopeless! It's hopeless!
[_He lets go his end of the trunk._
            </p>

        <p>
            
VILLAIN. Thirty miles to the nearest town! Thirty miles!
        </p>
        <p>
            COMEDIAN. It's an outrage how far people move their towns away from us.
        </p>
        <p>
            VILLAIN. We won't strike a town until the day after to-morrow.
        </p>
        <p>
            COMEDIAN. Hurrah! That's luck for you! There's yet a day-after-to-morrow
for us.
        </p>
        <p>
            VILLAIN. And the old women are still far behind us. Crawling!
        </p>
        <p>
            COMEDIAN. We won't give them votes, that's settled. Down with votes for
women!
